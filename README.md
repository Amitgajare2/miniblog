## Pre-Requirements

Django is an open-source web framework, written in Python, that follows the model-view-template architectural pattern. So Python is needed to be installed in your machine. Unfortunately, there was a significant update to Python several years ago that created a big split between Python versions namely Python 2 the legacy version and Python 3 the version in active development.

Since Python 3 is the current version in active development and addressed as the future of Python, Django rolled out a significant update, and now all the releases after Django 2.0 are only compatible with Python 3.x. Therefore this tutorial is strictly for Python 3.x. Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your machine if not follow the below guides.
